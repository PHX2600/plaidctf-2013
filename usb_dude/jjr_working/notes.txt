usbude i believe is just a reference to avrdude which is used to program avr devices and that this is pretty clearly a packet dump of USB handshaking

So its very likely clearly a hex burn from avrdude using the avr isp mkii programmer

most likely want to put the hex back together, then decompile it as assembly


For shits and kicks I grabbed my similar USBasp programmer from www.fischl.de and tried to output avrdude code of a bootloader and fuse burn. Those are here in this directory along with the hex I burnt (just a random arduino bootloader hex)

Still not familiar with how to pcap MY burn so we can compare, or if someone has one of these or an open source hardware version http://www.adafruit.com/products/708

Hrm with usbmon maybe?

Its probably a hex, maybe you can burn an elf from avr studio, but Im guessing they used linux tools not proprietary ones.

intel hex

every line starts with a colon, wonder if avrdude bothers to send them  0x3A

Jeremy capped our atmega hex burn. Note its all ins no outs. Maybe ours doesnt verify in between?

Looking in this pcap now to find stuff in our atmega hex
