Wanted to share my working notes with you guys:

Notable-- 

URB control is 0x02 (usb.transfer_type == 2)

Next important piece IMO is understanding what the usb.data_len actually is.  Based on packets the URB data length values show up as 1,4,7,8,10,13,18,24,28,32,64 blah blah blah.. 

I defined usb.data_len == 64 which pulled up all the largest packets with size 128 which are your URB_BULK outs. See packets # 152 + however with these packets they are actually usb.transfer_type == 3 (0x03).


::::CMD USED::::
tshark -r usbdude.pcap-25abb154182cd183b0667ef0bd38577c58ea4e08 -R "usb.transfer_type == 3 && usb.data_len == 64" -T fields -e usb.capdata > filtered_usb_dump




Now I am at trying to figure out how to reassemble these to make sense.
